Metrics help you track and visualize the data points you care about, making it easier to monitor your application's health and identify issues.
Learn more about [Metrics](/product/metrics).

## Requirements
- [Install](/product/cli/installation) Sentry CLI (min v2.32.0).

## Configuration

Sentry CLI uses your project's DSN to authorize sending metrics. To set it up, export the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable:

<SignInNote />
```bash
export SENTRY_DSN=___PUBLIC_DSN___
```

Alternatively, you can add it to your `~/.sentryclirc` config file:

```ini {filename:~/.sentryclirc}
[auth]
dsn = ___PUBLIC_DSN___
```

## Sending metrics
When emitting a metric that doesn't exist, the metric will be created for you. If it already exists, it will be updated.
All metric types support custom units and tags provided with the `-u` and `-t` parameters respectively:

```bash
sentry-cli send-metric increment -n "MyMetric" -u "MyUnit" -t "tag1:val1","tag2:val2"
```


The metric's name, unit, and tags will undergo normalization to only include supported characters.
Learn more about [Supported Characters](/product/metrics/#supported-characters) and [Metric Tag Lengths](/product/metrics/#metric-tags-length).

### Counters
To increment a counter metric by one, you only need to provide the `--name` or `-n` parameter.
A counter metric can also be incremented by a custom value using the `-v` parameter:

```bash
sentry-cli send-metric increment -n "MyMetric" -v 3.14
```


### Gauges
To emit a gauge metric, you always need to provide the name and value:

```bash
sentry-cli send-metric gauge -n "MyMetric" -v 3.14
```

### Distributions
Similar to gauges, you need to provide the name and value to emit a distribution metric:

```bash
sentry-cli send-metric distribution -n "MyMetric" -v 3.14
```

### Sets
To emit a set metric, you also just need to provide the name and value.
The value can be any string or number:

```
sentry-cli send-metric set -n "MyMetric" -v "3a48b19"
```
